# LoRADiffuser
This project implements a LoRA-based fine-tuning pipeline for Stable Diffusion models to adapt them to custom datasets. It supports training LoRA modules, injecting trained weights into a diffusion model, and generating images from textual prompts. The project also includes tools for evaluating model performance using CLIP scores and other metrics.
